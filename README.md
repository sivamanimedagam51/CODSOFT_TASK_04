## 🧠 How the Game Works

1. User chooses **rock**, **paper**, or **scissors**
2. Computer randomly selects one of the three options
3. Game logic checks:

   * Rock beats Scissors
   * Scissors beats Paper
   * Paper beats Rock
4. Display:

   * User choice
   * Computer choice
   * Result: **Win**, **Lose**, or **Tie**
5. Score tracking (optional)
6. Ask user if they want to play again
